# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means

This is a **small project** that applies the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm to group retail store customers based on their purchase behavior.

## 📌 Objective

To identify different customer segments using unsupervised learning, which can help in targeted marketing and business insights.

## 🧠 What I Did

* Performed basic **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
* Scaled features for better clustering
* Used the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters
* Visualized the segmented customer groups

## 📚 What I Learned

* How clustering can uncover hidden customer patterns
* Importance of feature scaling in unsupervised learning
* How to apply K-Means in real-world retail scenarios

## 📂 Dataset

Publicly available customer data (e.g., Annual Income, Spending Score, Age).

## 📊 Tools Used

* Python
* Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
